# CVE-2016-5639
Crestron AirMedia AM-100 Traversal and Hashdump Metasploit Modules

Two similar modules that take advantage of CVE-2016-5639 to dump hashes and retrieve files through path traversal. I made these modules separate because I wanted experience writing something that could "dump" hashes, correctly format them for cracking, and add them to the loot. Any suggestions welcome.
