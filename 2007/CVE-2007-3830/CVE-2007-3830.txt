The IBM Proventia Sensor Appliance is prone to multiple input-validation vulnerabilities, including multiple remote file-include issues and a cross-site scripting issue.

An attacker can exploit these issues to steal cookie-based authentication credentials, view files, and to execute arbitrary server-side script code on an affected 
device in the context of the webserver process. Other attacks are also possible.

IBM Proventia Sensor Appliance CX5108 and GX5008 are vulnerable.
