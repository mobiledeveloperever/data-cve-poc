# CVE-2018-9276 PRTG < 18.2.39 Authenticated Command Injection (Reverse Shell)
https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2018-9276

Improved version of an exploit written by https://github.com/M4LV0.  I used the POST data from their script but just made it more reliable as I didnt have much success with it.

Payload delivery is essentially smb_delivery.  Impacket serves up a .dll generated by msfvenom, rundll32.exe does all the work.

Tested on Windows Server 2016 against PRTG 18.1.37.

## Dependancies

By no means is this well written and it's cobbled together from stackoverflow.  This was developed for use with Kali Linux and assumes the following is available:
* Impacket
* Netcat
* Msfvenom

## Assumptions
This is a point and shoot exploit, all you need to know are the admin credentials for the PRTG instance (default prtgadmin:prtgadmin).  Depending on the configuration of the target machiene, your milage may vary.  The following assumptions have been made:
* Target machine is Windows;
* Defender / Applocker is not running; and
* Outbound SMB access is permitted

## Installation


```bash
git clone https://github.com/wildkindcc/CVE-2018-9276.git
python CVE-2018-9276.py -h
```

## Usage
Figure out the credentials and drop shells :)
```python
