Description: 
The "CLink4Service" service is installed with Corsair Link 4 with insecure permissions by default. This allows unprivileged users to take control of the service and execute commands in the context of NT_Authority\SYSTEM, leading to total system takeover. Service takeover can be achieved by modification of the BINARY_PATH_NAME property of the the service. Currently, the Windows 'Everyone' security group is able to modify this property, with permissions granted at the 'SERVICE_ALL_ACCESS' level.
