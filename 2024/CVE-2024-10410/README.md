[Online Hotel Reservation System in PHP/MySQLi with Source Code | SourceCodester](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/13492/online-hotel-reservation-system-phpmysqli.html)



### Description

A high risk vulnerability was found in Online Hotel Reservation System, affecting the upload function of /marimar/admin/mod_room/controller.php file. The bypass detection operation of image parameter resulted in unlimited file upload. Attacks can be launched remotely



### Analysis vulnerability

`marimar\admin\mod_room\controller.php`

![image-20241025214231335](assets/image-20241025214231335.png)

After the file is uploaded, the `$image_name` variable changes the file name to the current year, month, and day, then adds `_` and the uploaded file name

The vulnerability lies in the `$image_size` variable, which detects whether it is an image file, and otherwise disables uploading. So all we have to do is add the header of the image in front of the injected malicious file to bypass detection
