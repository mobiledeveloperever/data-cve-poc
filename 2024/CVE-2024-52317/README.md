CVE-2024-52317 - Apache Tomcat HTTP/2 Data Leakage Vulnerability


Overview
CVE-2024-52317  is a vulnerability affecting Apache Tomcat's HTTP/2 implementation. The issue arises due to improper recycling of HTTP/2 request and response resources, potentially leading to data leakage between users. This means that sensitive data from one user might appear in the response sent to another user.



 Affected Versions

The following versions of Apache Tomcat are vulnerable:

Version Series	Affected Versions
Apache Tomcat 11.0	Versions prior to 11.0.0
Apache Tomcat 10.1	Versions prior to 10.1.31
Apache Tomcat 9.0	Versions prior to 9.0.96




 Exploitability

 Attack Vector

 How the Exploit Works:  
  An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple HTTP/2 requests to a target server, triggering resource reuse issues that result in data leakage. Specifically, one userâ€™s response may inadvertently include sensitive data belonging to another user.

 Potential Impact:
   Leakage of sensitive user data, including session cookies, tokens, or private information.
   Potential escalation of privilege using leaked session tokens or credentials.
   Disruption of data integrity in a multiuser environment.



 Mitigation

 Upgrade

To resolve this vulnerability, upgrade to a patched version of Apache Tomcat:

 Apache Tomcat 11.0.0 or later.
 Apache Tomcat 10.1.31 or later.
 Apache Tomcat 9.0.96 or later.

 Configuration Adjustments

If upgrading is not immediately feasible:
1. Disable HTTP/2 to mitigate the risk:

   <Connector port="8443" protocol="org.apache.coyote.http11.Http11NioProtocol" />
   ```
   Remove any HTTP/2 configurations in the server settings.

2. Implement strict monitoring of HTTP/2 traffic for anomalies or unexpected patterns.
