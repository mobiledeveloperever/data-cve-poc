To test whether the browser can parse JavaScript code, we added an 'h' tag after the title.

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c7d9dae3-1b5c-4834-9741-2c1c82c2aa7a)
When viewing the page source code on the homepage of the website, we found that the h tag was wrapped in the title tag.

We reconstructed the PoC closed title tag. Poc: `</title><h1>777</h1><title>`

When we visited the website homepage again, we found that the browser was parsing the h tag.

We are trying to construct a pop-up warning event. Poc: `</title><script>alert(1)</script>`
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/86471ba0-f132-492c-927b-d241fac51d7f)
Every time we visit the homepage of a website, an XSS vulnerability is triggered and a pop-up warning appears.

Vulnerability analysis:
The relevant code can be found in the web() function of the application/admin/controller/System.php file.

The server code has performed regular judgment on the title, which involves removing the<script>tag and its surrounding content. You may wonder how a pop-up window can still appear even after removing the<script>tag and its package content?

When we debug the code, we find that the information entered by the user is HTML materialized after passing through the input() function.

That's why user input strings can bypass server detection and parse JavaScript scripts.
Later, the server directly stored the HTML materialized string into the database.

When the browser requests to read the website title, the server will decode the HTML entity of the website title read from the database.
