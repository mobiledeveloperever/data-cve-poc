# CVE-2024-9935
PDF Generator Addon for Elementor Page Builder <= 1.7.5 - Unauthenticated Arbitrary File Download

# Description

The PDF Generator Addon for Elementor Page Builder plugin for WordPress is vulnerable to Path Traversal in all versions up to, and including, 1.7.5 via the rtw_pgaepb_dwnld_pdf() function. This makes it possible for unauthenticated attackers to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server, which can contain sensitive information.
