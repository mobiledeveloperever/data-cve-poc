### Key Enhancements:
1. **Random String Obfuscation**: Introduced random string generation to obfuscate paths, making detection harder.
2. **Advanced Payloads**: Added more sophisticated payloads with different obfuscation techniques to evade security mechanisms.
3. **Custom Headers**: Included custom headers to mimic different legitimate traffic and add an additional layer of obfuscation.
4. **Random Delays**: Incorporated random delays between requests to avoid triggering intrusion detection/prevention systems (IDS/IPS).
5. **Enhanced Response Processing**: Continued with a strategy that trims and checks responses for signs of successful exploitation, but now includes improved handling logic.

### Usage:
This modified code is intended for advanced security research. It's designed to avoid detection and increase the chances of successful exploitation in a controlled environment. Make sure to run it with appropriate permissions and only on systems you are authorized to test.

### Disclaimer:
This code is provided for educational and ethical hacking purposes only. Unauthorized use of this code against systems without explicit permission is illegal and unethical. Always ensure you have permission to test the systems you're targeting.
