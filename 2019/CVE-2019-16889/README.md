Resource consumption Denial of service. This was reported last year and has been fixed as of version 2.0.3 . It has been assigned CVE-2019-16889.

This is my first time using asyncio, if you see a more efficient way to do this please let me know!

A requirements.txt file has been added to this repository so 'pip3 install -r requirements.txt' should work.
