# CVE-2023-43208 - Mirth Connect Remote Code Execution (RCE) Exploit üö®

## Introduction üìñ

This repository contains a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) exploit for a critical vulnerability in NextGen Healthcare Mirth Connect versions prior to 4.4.1. The vulnerability, tracked as CVE-2023-43208, allows for unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) on systems running the vulnerable software versions.

Mirth Connect, an open-source healthcare integration engine, failed to properly handle deserialized data, making it susceptible to arbitrary OS command execution through specially crafted HTTP requests. The vulnerability was discovered following an incomplete patch for CVE-2023-37679, initially addressed by IHTeam. Subsequent research by Horizon3.ai revealed a bypass to the deny list implemented in the original patch, leading to the identification of CVE-2023-43208. This exploit module has been successfully tested against Mirth Connect versions 4.1.1, 4.3.0, and 4.4.0.
