## Oracle VirtualBox VGA OOB-Read Vulnerability

This Proof of Concept (PoC) is designed for a Linux guest OS running on a Windows host OS.

The purpose of this PoC is to demonstrate the ability to leak addresses of VirtualBox components. You may need to adjust the pointer values within the `vga_exp` function to match the specific builds you are testing.

Currently, the success rate is relatively low. Contributions to improve its reliability are highly appreciated.
