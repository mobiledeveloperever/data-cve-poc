## Vulnerability Details
This vulnerability is present in the exportFile.jsp page of the OpenClinic GA web application, which fails to implement necessary authentication checks before allowing the download of files. This flaw grants attackers the ability to access and download potentially sensitive files without any form of user verification.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
  Steps to Reproduce:

    1. Identifying the Vulnerable Component:
      The vulnerability is located within the exportFile.jsp component of the OpenClinic GA application. Access is typically attempted through the URL http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/pharmacy/exportFile.jsp.
    
    2. Accessing the Vulnerable URL:
      Using a web browser, navigate to the aforementioned URL. Replace [IP] with the actual IP address or domain where OpenClinic GA is installed.
    
    3. Executing the Attack:
      Direct access to the exportFile.jsp URL does not require authentication. The absence of login credential requests or session checks allows the immediate download of files.

## Impact
The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data stored within the application's files, undermining the confidentiality and integrity of the information and potentially leading to further attacks on the system and its users.
