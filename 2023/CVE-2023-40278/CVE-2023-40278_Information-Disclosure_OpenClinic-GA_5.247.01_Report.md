# CVE-2023-40278: Information Disclosure via printAppointmentPdf.jsp in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01
## Abstract
An Information Disclosure vulnerability has been identified in the printAppointmentPdf.jsp component of OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01. This vulnerability arises from the application's mishandling of error messages in response to manipulated input, enabling attackers to infer the existence of specific appointments, potentially compromising the confidentiality of patient and clinic scheduling data.

## Identification
CVE ID: CVE-2023-40278

Exploit Title: Information Disclosure via printAppointmentPdf.jsp in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

Date Discovered: 2023-08-14

Affected Software: OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01

Vendor: OpenClinic

Software Link: [SourceForge Project Page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-clinic/)

Tested Environments: Windows 10, Windows 11

## Vulnerability Details
The issue is present in the printAppointmentPdf.jsp page, which is utilized for generating PDF documents of appointments. Due to improper error handling, when the AppointmentUid parameter is manipulated, the application responds with varying error messages. These responses inadvertently reveal whether an appointment with the specified AppointmentUid exists, leading to information disclosure.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
  Steps to Reproduce:

    1. Access the Vulnerable Component:
      Go to the URL: http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/planning/printAppointmentPdf.jsp?AppointmentUid=1.1, substituting [IP] with the actual IP address or domain of the OpenClinic GA installation.

    2. Manipulating the AppointmentUid Parameter:
      Alter the AppointmentUid parameter by testing different numerical values or formats to explore various IDs.

    3. Observing the Responses:
      Pay attention to the application's response for different AppointmentUid values. A specific error message, such as "document is not open," signals the presence of an appointment with the tried ID. Conversely, other error messages or responses indicate the absence of such an appointment.

    4. Confirming the Vulnerability:
      The variation in error messages depending on the queried AppointmentUid confirms the Information Disclosure vulnerability, allowing unauthorized individuals to deduce the existence of specific appointments.

## Impact
This vulnerability could allow attackers to gain insights into the scheduling patterns of clinics, including the number and possibly the timing of appointments, without having direct access to the appointment data. This could lead to further privacy violations and potentially targeted attacks or social engineering efforts based on deduced appointment schedules.
