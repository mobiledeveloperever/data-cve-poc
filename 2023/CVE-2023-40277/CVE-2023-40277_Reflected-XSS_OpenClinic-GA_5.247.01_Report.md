# CVE-2023-40277: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

## Abstract
A significant Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability has been identified in OpenClinic GA, specifically in version 5.247.01. This vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser through improper input sanitization in the application's login.jsp page.

## Identification
CVE ID: CVE-2023-40277

Exploit Title: Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in OpenClinic GA 5.247.01

Date Discovered: 2023-08-14

Affected Software: OpenClinic GA version 5.247.01 and potentially previous versions

Vendor: OpenClinic

Software Link: [SourceForge Project Page](https://sourceforge.net/projects/open-clinic/)

Tested Environments: Windows 10, Windows 11

## Vulnerability Details
The vulnerability resides in the login.jsp file of the OpenClinic GA application, where the message parameter is not adequately sanitized. This oversight allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the page, which is then executed in the context of the user's browser.

## Proof of Concept (PoC)
  Steps to Reproduce:
   
    1. Identifying the Vulnerable Parameter:
      Access the login.jsp page of the OpenClinic GA web application. The format of the URL to this page is http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/login.jsp.
      
    2. Crafting the Malicious URL:
      Construct a URL by appending a JavaScript payload to the message parameter. For instance: http://[IP]:10088/openclinic/login.jsp?message=<script>alert('XSS vulnerability found!');</script>. Replace [IP] with the actual IP address or domain of the OpenClinic GA installation.
    
    3. Executing the Attack:
      Navigate to the crafted URL. The page will load and execute the injected script within the message parameter, confirming the Reflected XSS vulnerability.

## Impact
This vulnerability demonstrates that OpenClinic GA does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the message parameter, leading to a potential compromise of user data and session information. Attackers can exploit this to execute malicious scripts in the context of an unsuspecting user's session, thereby breaching confidentiality and integrity.
