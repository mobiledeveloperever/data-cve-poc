  name: Openstack Metadata Service Check
  author: sullo
  severity: critical
  verified: false
  description: The Openstack host is configured as a proxy which allows access to the instance metadata service. This could allow significant access to the host/infrastructure.
  remediation: Disable the proxy or restrict configuration to only allow access to approved hosts/ports. Upgrade to IMDSv2 if possible.
