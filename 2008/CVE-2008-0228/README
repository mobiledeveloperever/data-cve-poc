Reference implementation for TWSL2011-007 vulnerability workaround (aka 
CVE-2011-0228).

Author: Eric Monti
Date:   July 28, 2011

= Compiling

Compile with your Apple iOS SDK CFLAGS along with:
   gcc -o testcert testcert.m -framework Foundation -framework Security

The compile arguments above should work as-is for OS X if you just want
to check it out.

= Usage:

    $ testcert path/to/file.der severname

The file should be in raw DER format, which is just base64-decoded
data found beween the BEGIN and END CERTIFICATE lines in an encoded
certificate:

  -----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
  ...
  -----END CERTIFICATE-----
