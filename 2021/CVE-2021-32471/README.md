# Arbitrary Code Execution in the Universal Turing Machine

This is an implementation of the Universal Turing Machine as presented in Minsky, Computation: Finite and infinite machines, 1967, Chapter 7.

The default input to the simulated machine is an exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution.

The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2021-32471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32471) and is presented in detail in [Pontus Johnson](https://www.kth.se/profile/pontusj)'s paper [Intrinsic Propensity for Vulnerability in Computers? Arbitrary Code Execution in the Universal Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124) from 2021. There is also [a talk on YouTube](https://youtu.be/pujUhiX9Mvk) on the vulnerability and its exploitation.

A visual simulation of the exploit is available at https://intrinsic-propensity.github.io.
