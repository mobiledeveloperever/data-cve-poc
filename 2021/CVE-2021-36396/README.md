**Note on Injection Point and Request Data Modification:**
The current implementation of this exploit is designed to extract the database name and the name and hash of the first user created in Moodle. Depending on your specific requirements or the target system, you may need to modify the injection point and the request data within the exploit code. This involves adapting the SQL injection payload and potentially altering the HTTP request format to match the target system's expectations. Careful analysis of the target system's behavior is required to tailor the exploit effectively.
