This is a test file that contains several CVE identifiers.

The first one is CVE-2023-1234. This is a hypothetical vulnerability that was supposedly discovered in 2023.

Here's another one: CVE-2021-56789. This one was supposedly discovered in 2021.

And here's a third one: CVE-2020-1234567. This one was supposedly discovered in 2020.

But not all strings that look like CVE identifiers are actual CVE identifiers. For example, CVE-23-1234 is not a valid identifier because the year part only has two digits. Similarly, CVE-2023-123 is not valid because the identifier part only has three digits. And CVE-2023-12345678 is not valid because the identifier part has eight digits, which is too many.

Finally, note that not all CVE identifiers are associated with actual vulnerabilities. For example, CVE-2023-9999 might not be associated with any known vulnerability. To check if a CVE identifier is real, you would need to look it up in a CVE database.
