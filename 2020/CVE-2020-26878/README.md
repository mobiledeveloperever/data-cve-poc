# CVE-2020-26878

This is a modified version of the Ruckus exploit found at https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/49110

Since the original exploit was written for Python 2, I tweaked it a little to make it work with Python 3.

Note: I am not responsible for any illegal use of this exploit. This is only for educational and testing purposes, with the goal of securing systems.
