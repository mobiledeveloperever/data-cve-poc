= CVE-2013-2094 code for
http://timetobleed.com/a-closer-look-at-a-recent-privilege-escalation-bug-in-linux-cve-2013-2094/

== How to build

You need to build the C file of your choice like this:

gcc -O2 file-name.c

-O2 is required due to how the exploit actually works (see the blog post for
more information).

== Why

I thought the original exploit was cool and really interesting, but hard to
understand especially for beginners so I decided to rewrite it a bit, add lots
of comments, and write a blog post about it.
